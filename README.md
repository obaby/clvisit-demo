# CLVisit-Demo

This is a sample app that displays a basic implementation of CLVisist now
available in iOS 8 which allows your app to receive location events from the
system whenever a user is present at one place for more than just a moment and
when they then leave that area.  These are referred to as "visits" and can be
handy if you want to know that a user has visited a restaurant, gone to class,
etc so that you can send them some sort of notification.

The demo app here contains two components for familiarizing you with the API:
it posts a local notification as soon as an event is received, and it plots the
location of each of those events on a map so you can gauge the accuracy for
yourself.

While vetting this for a work project I installe it onto my phone and carried
it with me all day to see how it would turn my days movements into a sequence
of visits.
